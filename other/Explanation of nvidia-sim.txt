Explanation of Metrics Used

The script now queries metrics that are explicitly supported based on the output from nvidia-smi on your system. Here are the metrics included:

    index: GPU index.
    timestamp: The time when the data was collected.
    name: The name of the GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080).
    driver_version: The driver version currently in use.
    uuid: Unique identifier for the GPU.
    utilization.gpu: GPU utilization as a percentage.
    utilization.memory: Memory utilization as a percentage.
    memory.total: Total amount of GPU memory.
    memory.used: Amount of GPU memory currently being used.
    memory.free: Amount of GPU memory that is free.
    temperature.gpu: Current temperature of the GPU.
    power.draw: Current power draw of the GPU in watts.
    power.limit: Power limit of the GPU.
    clocks.current.graphics, clocks.current.sm, clocks.current.memory: Current clock frequencies of the graphics, SM (streaming multiprocessor), and memory.
    clocks.max.graphics, clocks.max.sm, clocks.max.memory: Maximum clock frequencies of the graphics, SM, and memory.
    fan.speed: Fan speed percentage.
    pcie.link.gen.current, pcie.link.gen.max: Current and maximum PCIe generation.
    pcie.link.width.current, pcie.link.width.max: Current and maximum PCIe link width.
    encoder.stats.sessionCount, encoder.stats.averageFps, encoder.stats.averageLatency: Encoder statistics, such as the number of active sessions, average frames per second, and average latency.

1 Second (-l 1): Capturing metrics every 1 secon
Milliseconds (-lms): Capture metrics in milliseconds intervals
