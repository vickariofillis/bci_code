ID-20: Speech decoder

## Runtime Phases

The Python scripts emit standardized log lines during execution:

```
PHASE <TAG> <START|END> ABS:<seconds>.<micros> REL:<seconds>.<micros>
```

The workload is split into three segments. Each segment logs its own phases so that performance can be analyzed in isolation.

### RNN Segment

- **Setup (SETUP)** – parse arguments, load the trained RNN and dataset.
- **Inference (INFER)** – run the recurrent network on the data to generate logits.
- **Save Results (SAVE)** – write the logits and associated metadata to `rnn_results.pkl`.

### Language Model Segment (WFST LM)

- **Setup (SETUP)** – process command‑line arguments and locate the WFST decoder files.
- **Decoder Initialization (DECODER_INIT)** – load the WFST and configure the decoder.
- **Load Results (LOAD)** – read the RNN logits from disk.
- **Decode Hypotheses (DECODE)** – generate n‑best transcriptions with the language model.
- **Save Results (SAVE)** – store the n‑best lists in `nbest_results.pkl`.

### Large Language Model Segment (LLM)

- **Load Results (LOAD)** – load both the RNN logits and the WFST n‑best lists.
- **Setup (SETUP)** – instantiate the LLM and tokenizer.
- **Rescore Hypotheses (RESCORE)** – apply the LLM to rescore each hypothesis and compute metrics.

These tags allow performance metrics to be correlated with the activity of each segment.
