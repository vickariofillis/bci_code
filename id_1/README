ID-1: Seizure detection

In this folder we present Laelaps algorithm, implemented with C programming language and parallelized using OpenMP.
The reported version works with data of Patient 12 of the dataset, but it is general and adaptable to any patient.
List of files:
- associative_memory.h: function interface of the corresponding .c file.
- associative_memory.c: contains the function to classify the query vector, comparing it with the associative memory.
- aux_functions.h: function interface of the corresponding .c file.
- aux_functions.c: It contains all the principal functions of the algorithm: (1) LBP_Spatial_encoding, (2) temporal_encoder, (3) postprocess. All the functions are parallelized among multiple threads.
- data.h: it holds the item memories and the associative_memory 
- data2.h: it contains the test sample of the iEEG segment of Patient 12: seizure starts approximately after second 220.
- init.h: contains all the initialization, from frequency to number of channel or dimension of hypervectors.
- main.c: it call the previous functions to calssify an iEEG segment.
The commands to compile and then execute the program on a Linux shell are:
gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp main.c -o main -lm command
./main

## Runtime Phases

The program prints standardized log lines to mark important phases. Each line
includes the phase tag, whether it marks the start or end, and both absolute and
relative timestamps:

```
PHASE <TAG> <START|END> ABS:<seconds>.<micros> REL:<seconds>.<micros>
```

The phases are:

- **Initialization (INIT)** – sets up all hypervectors, allocates working buffers and prepares the algorithm state. This occurs once before processing any EEG window.
- **Spatial Encoding (SPATIAL)** – computes Local Binary Pattern features on the current EEG window to construct an intermediate hypervector capturing spatial relations among channels.
- **Temporal Encoding (TEMPORAL)** – compresses the sequence of spatial hypervectors into a single vector that reflects how the signal evolves over time within the window.
- **Classification (CLASSIFY)** – compares the temporal vector against the associative memory to decide whether the window indicates seizure or non‑seizure activity.
- **Post‑processing (POSTPROC)** – aggregates predictions from consecutive windows via majority voting and prints the resulting classification.

These tags appear in the log output and can be correlated with performance data.
